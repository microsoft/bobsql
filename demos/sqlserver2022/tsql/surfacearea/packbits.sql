-- Let's pack 2 numbers, 6 and 4, into a single 8 byte
-- 6 is 0110 and 4 is 0100
-- To do this I want to store 0110 in the upper bits and 0100 in the lower bits
-- So 0110 0100 is 100 in decimal
-- But instead of treating this as 1 number I want to manipulate each on as they are separate
-- Shift left 4 bits the value of 6
-- The result is 96 which is 0110 0000
-- Now just add 4 and you get 100
DECLARE @x tinyint
DECLARE @y tinyint
SELECT @x = LEFT_SHIFT(6, 4) + 4
SELECT @x = (6 << 4 ) + 4
SELECT @x
-- Only give me upper bits. @y should now be 6
SELECT @y = RIGHT_SHIFT(@x, 4)
SELECT @y
-- Let's use SETBIT to clear the upper bits to get the lower
SELECT @x = SET_BIT(@x, 4, 0)
SELECT @x = SET_BIT(@x, 5, 0)
SELECT @x = SET_BIT(@x, 6, 0)
